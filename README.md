# faceDetector
It is a program developed in Python to safeguard places such as banks, jewellery shops and etc against the theft.


The project aims to develop a system to detect physical intrusion using a web cam and to alert the user of the same by making a call to the userâ€™s mobile, using a client side program which will use VOIP.
The main tool that we will be using to implement this whole idea is OpenCV library and  VOIP.
As the name of the title suggests this project is basically divided into two parts :-
Theft detection
Theft Alerter
